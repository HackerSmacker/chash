# chash
An ANSI C compliant hashtable implementation.

REFACTORING PLAN:
- Rewrite manuals and add more
- Use namespace for values instead of a settings macro
- Cap to 80 character lines
- Fix up backslashes
- Replace occurrences of 'chash' with just 'hashtable'
- Make 'stackful' behavior its own macro
